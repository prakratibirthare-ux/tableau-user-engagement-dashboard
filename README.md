# tableau-user-engagement-dashboard
Interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing user engagement by age group, subscription status, session length distribution, and geographic location.
## Dashboard Layout

The dashboard is organized into three logical rows to guide users from high-level context to deeper behavioral analysis.

### Upper Row – Engagement & Geography
- Engagement Overview: Displays overall user engagement to provide immediate context on product usage
- Geographic Location Map: Shows average user engagement by country to identify regional patterns and differences

This row answers the question: *Who is engaging and where?*

### Middle Row – Session Behavior
- Average Session Length: Highlights how long users spend in the product on average, serving as a bridge between high-level engagement and detailed behavioral analysis

This row answers the question: *How long do users engage?*

### Lower Row – Subscription & Behavioral Patterns
- Paid vs Unpaid Users: Compares engagement levels between paid and free users to identify behavioral differences
- Scatter Plot (User Engagement vs Session Length): Visualizes the relationship between session length and engagement, highlighting trends, clusters, and potential power users

This row answers the question: *Why does engagement differ across users?*

The layout is designed to support intuitive storytelling, moving from overview to explanation while enabling interactive exploration through dashboard actions.
